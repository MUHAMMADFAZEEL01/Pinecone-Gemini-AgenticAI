        " The goal is to extract insights from the document using similarity search, embeddings, and a generative AI model (Google's Gemini model). Here's the breakdown of the process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install Required Libraries**:\n",
        "    - We use `langchain-chroma` for vector storage and similarity search.\n",
        "    - `langchain-google-genai` is used to interact with Google's generative AI models.\n",
        "    - `PyPDFLoader` is used to load and parse the PDF file.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loading the PDF Document**:\n",
        "    - The `PyPDFLoader` is used to load and extract the content from the specified PDF file.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Setting Up API Keys**:\n",
        "    - The Google API key and credentials are set up to authenticate and access Google's AI services.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Creating Embeddings**:\n",
        "    - Using Google's embedding model (`embedding-001`), we create a vector representation of the content of the PDF document.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Storing Vectors with Chroma**:\n",
        "    - We store the document embeddings using Chroma's vector store, which will allow us to perform similarity searches based on user queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Query Input from User**:\n",
        "    - The user is prompted to ask a question about the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Similarity Search**:\n",
        "    - A similarity search is performed on the document's embeddings to find the most relevant context that answers the user's query.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Generating the Response**:\n",
        "    - The retrieved context and user query are fed into a generative AI model (Google's Gemini-1.5) to generate a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Displaying the Result**:\n",
        "    - The generated response is displayed to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Vector Embeddings**: Vector embeddings allow representing text or documents as vectors (numerical representations). This is useful for tasks like document similarity and semantic search.\n",
        "- **Similarity Search**: This technique helps identify the most relevant pieces of text or documents based on a given query by comparing the vector representations.\n",
        "- **Generative AI**: Google's Gemini-1.5 model is used here to generate a coherent response based on the provided context and query.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach leverages AI to analyze content in a meaningful and contextual way, making it a powerful tool for document-based question answering.\n",
