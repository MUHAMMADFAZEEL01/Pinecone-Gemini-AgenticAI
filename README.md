# Pinecone-Gemini-AgenticAI
This repository demonstrates the integration of Pinecone, Gemini API, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for AI projects. It enables efficient vector storage, retrieval, and context-aware text generation. Use cases include semantic search, chatbots, recommendation systems, and question answering with scalable AI solutions.

### **Features:**
- **Vector Storage & Retrieval**: Use **Pinecone** to store and manage high-dimensional vectors for efficient similarity search.
- **Gemini API Integration**: Leverage **Gemini API** to generate text and process natural language queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combine retrieval and generation to build AI systems capable of answering questions, providing recommendations, and more.

### **Use Cases:**
- **Semantic Search**: Retrieve relevant documents based on meaning, not keywords.
- **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants**: Provide intelligent and context-aware responses using retrieved data.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Recommend content or products based on user preferences and vector data.
- **Question Answering**: Use vector retrieval and text generation to answer user queries accurately.

### **Steps in the Project:**
1. **Pinecone Setup**: Initialize Pinecone with your API key and set up the environment (e.g., `us-east1-gcp`).
2. **Create Index**: Create a Pinecone index to store vectors with defined dimensions and similarity metrics.
3. **Upsert Vectors**: Upload vectors representing your data (e.g., documents or queries) to the Pinecone index.
4. **Query Pinecone**: Perform similarity search by querying Pinecone to retrieve the most relevant vectors based on input.
5. **Gemini API Integration**: Use Gemini API to generate responses based on the retrieved vectors.
6. **Retrieval and Generation**: Combine vector search and text generation to build intelligent AI models that can understand and respond based on context.

### **Code Overview:**

The following key steps are demonstrated in the code:

- **Initialization**: Setup for **Pinecone** and **Gemini API** using your API keys.
- **Index Creation**: Code to create and manage the index in Pinecone.
- **Upsert Vectors**: Insert vectors into the Pinecone index.
- **Querying**: Retrieve similar vectors from the index based on a query.
- **Gemini API for Generation**: Use the Gemini API to generate context-aware responses based on the retrieved data.
  
### **Code Snippet Example:**

```python
import pinecone
import openai
import os

# Initialize Pinecone
pinecone.init(api_key="your-pinecone-api-key", environment="us-west1-gcp")
index = pinecone.Index("example-index")

# Initialize OpenAI (Gemini)
openai.api_key = "your-gemini-api-key"

# Example data (vectors)
vectors = [
    {"id": "1", "values": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]},
    {"id": "2", "values": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]},
]

# Upsert vectors into Pinecone
index.upsert(vectors=vectors)

# Querying Pinecone
query_vector = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]  # Example query vector
results = index.query(query_vector, top_k=3)

# Retrieve relevant data from the results
retrieved_data = [result['id'] for result in results['matches']]

# Using Gemini API to generate a response based on the retrieved data
response = openai.Completion.create(
    model="text-davinci-003",  # Replace with the appropriate Gemini model
    prompt=f"Answer based on the following data: {retrieved_data}",
    max_tokens=100
)

print(response.choices[0].text)
```

### **Technologies Used:**
- **Pinecone**: For vector storage and similarity search.
- **Gemini API**: For language modeling and text generation.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementing the code.
